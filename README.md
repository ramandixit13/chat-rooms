# chat-rooms
A chatroom project built through python using classes and methods, which allows you to create chat-rooms and send messages to Recipients.
Chat Rooms:
You have been pretty disappointed at the current quality of chat room applications and vow to create your own, start up a new Internet company, obtain venture capital funding, integrate advertisement into your chat program, quintuple revenues in a six-month period, go public, and retire. However, none of this will happen if you do not have a pretty cool chat application.


There are three classes you will need:
1.)A Message class containing a message string and any additional information such as broadcast or single recipient
2.)A User class that contains all the information for a person entering your chat rooms
3.)A Room class that represents a more sophisticated chat system where users can create separate "rooms" within the chat area and invite others to join
